# WE ALL LOVE TECH INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
### BUT ANSWERING THEM IS THE HARD PART
So let's collaborate to write clear code with explanatory documentation, to help all us Fellows chew bubblegum and kick ass and run out of bubblegum when we have the onsite or a phone interview.

## ANYONE IS INVITED TO THROW IN THIER TWO CENTS
But please include your name/github/email and a date in the documentation!
